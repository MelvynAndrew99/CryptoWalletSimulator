# Crypto Wallet Simulator

To run just open download the index.html file and double-click on it to open in a browser.

## Purpose

I didn't design this to be perfect, I found that scammers are often sloppy when they think they have you hooked.  This tool will be updated as the needs change.  For now the scammers I dealt with wanted screenshots of me sending them bitcoin.  So this gave me the ability to procrastinate longer.

So it all runs locally, no money or btc will be actually sent.  Using the test block chain is another alternative, but requires you request test tokens, which means you can't send anything substantial.
